Extensible set of little one-off features that Google or Bing are missing, such as color and unit conversions, etc.

Isn't it frustrating when you need to calculate something simple and your search engine just gives you a list of websites full of ads instead of instantly returning the answer as you type? They're getting better at it by adding calculator, unit-conversions, currency exchange rates, stock tickers etc. but sometimes they just fail, for instance as of October 2015 search engines don't return satisfactory results for RGB(23,175,195).

I'm going to build a simple extensible website where I will accumulate simple instant solutions to one-off classes of problems where a search engine has failed me. [http://wolframalpha.com](http://wolframalpha.com) gives great results in most cases however it's too slow to be useful as a super quick one-off tool. However I like the spirit of Wolfram Alpha, but it is still not extensible by me (I can't plug my own one-off solutions).

All solutions are instant as-you-type results, no need for the search button.

You can preview the live site now at [http://quickinfo.io](quickinfo.io).

Supported answers for now:
 1. Color conversions - convert an RGB triplet to Hex color or hex color to RGB ("23 145 175", "#eeaaf0")
 2. Weight conversions - convert pounds to kg and vice versa ("190 pounds", "200lb", "43 kg")
 3. Temperature conversions - fahrenheit/celsius ("75f", "75 f", "75 fahrenheit", "23c", "23 c")

Feel free to fork away and host your own modified copies. I will consider accepting very high quality pull requests that contribute new solutions or fix bugs.
